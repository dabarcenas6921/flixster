### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

All the topics discussed in this week's lab prepared me to complete this assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I'm currently working on adding additional features. One of the things I would do is to a drop-down menu with ways to filter the movies by genre or by other parameters.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project. The whole process was smooth. I first created an HTML skeleton and then worked on the Javascript which helped a lot with getting organized. Looking through the API documentation to find what I needed was a little difficult because the documentation is not clear but I was finally able to make everything work.

### Open-source libraries used

Shoutout to Moe for helping me with the CSS for the movie cards.
